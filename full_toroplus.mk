# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for toroplus hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and maguro, hence its name.
#

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/aosp_base_telephony.mk)
# This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
#$(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)
# Inherit from toroplus device
$(call inherit-product, device/samsung/toroplus/device.mk)

# Get the long list of APNs
$(call inherit-product, vendor/cna/configs/apns.mk)
